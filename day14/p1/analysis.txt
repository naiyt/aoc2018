This one was pretty interesting (although I'm not a huge fan of the overly
convuluted problem descriptions on problems like this). Initially looked very
similar to a Fibonacci style problem, with the added complexity of having
to dynamically move your two pointers through the array. My initial implementation
was recursive (since that's the natural place to start with a sequence problem),
but that resulted in a stack size problem for my problem input. The iterative solution
was pretty much just a simple as the recursive one, though, which was nice.
