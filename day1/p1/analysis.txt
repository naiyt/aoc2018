Super simple starting problem. Just convert string input into an array of integers and sum the array.
O(N) runtime and O(1) space. The one potential edge case is an empty string / array. For this problem
I decided to handle the actual string conversion outside of the solution method to keep the responsibility
of the solution self contained. Future solutions might take a different approach, if the string parsing
is more complex, or more tightly coupled with the solution.
