My solutions for the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

I'm doing the solutions in [https://crystal-lang.org/](Crystal), as a way to learn the language a bit better.

To run any of the solutions, install Crystal then run `crystal spec solution_spec.cr` inside the relevant problem directory. Seperating the solutions from the test input using specs makes it easy to test all the edge cases, and keeps the actual solution files themselves nice and clean.
