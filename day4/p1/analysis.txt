This problem is interesting from an input validation standpoint, as there are a lot of edge cases.
(Is every row formatted properly? Are the dates valid? Do the waking up / falling asleep rows
follow the proper pattern? Are the guard's schedule's all properly aligned?)

I decided against getting too deep into input validation on this, because I don't want to spend
hours on the problem. Run time is just O(N), extra space is an array of 60 32 bit integers for each
guard. The main algorithmically interesting thing is keeping track of the falling asleep / waking up
flags as we iterate through our list of records.
