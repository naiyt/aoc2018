This solution just iterates through each cell in the grid, calculates its powerlevel, and then calculates the
power level of the 3x3 block starting at that point. Uses some dynamic programming to make sure that the power_level
is only calculated once for each cell, even when we iterate through all of the adjacent cells.

Runtime is O(N) (where N is the number of cells in the grid), because we only calculate the power level once for every N. We do have to check
the power level of the block starting at (x,y), but those should be simple array accesses in situations
where the power level has already been calculated.
