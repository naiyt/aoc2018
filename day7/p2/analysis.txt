Didn't spend a ton of time on this solution, and I'm sure it could be a lot faster. The biggest
problem is that I'm actually manually ticking, and iterating through the loop for every "second",
and then checking to see the status of workers, and queueing new nodes as workers become available.
There's probably a smart solution that doesn't require actually doing that. On top of that, there's
a lot of work in each iteration that could be optimized. Still, this is fast enough for the problem input
(< 1.5ms in release mode).
